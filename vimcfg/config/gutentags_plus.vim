" How to use Pygments Plug-in Parser
"
" Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter for wide variety of
" programming languages. This plug-in use Pygments and Exuberant
" Ctags as a parser to treat both definitions and references.
"
" You need the following software:
" o Python 2.6 or later (3 is also supported)
" o Pygments python package 1.6 or later
" o Exuberant Ctags 5.5 or later (optional)
"
" [Installation]
"
" 1. Check
"
" Make sure python and ctags can be invoked in your command line.
" $ type python
" python is /usr/bin/python
" $ type ctags
" ctags is /usr/local/bin/ctags
"
" 2. Installation of GLOBAL
"
" $ ./configure
" $ make
" $ sudo make install
"
" 3. Setup of Pygments plug-in parser
"
" The definition of Pygments plug-in parser is prepared
" in the default configuration file. Please specify it.
"
" $ export GTAGSCONF=/usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.conf
" $ export GTAGSLABEL=pygments
"
" [Execution of gtags]
"
" Please execute gtags(1) as usual.
"
" $ gtags
"
" If it is doubtful whether Pygments plug-in parser is used,
" please try --explain option. It shows the libraries used by
" gtags.
"
" $ gtags --explain
" ...
" File './lib/xmalloc.c' is handled as follows:
"         suffix:   |.c|
"         language: |C|
"         parser:   |parser|
"         library:  |/usr/local/lib/gtags/pygments-parser.la|
"
