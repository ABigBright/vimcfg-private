" If you want to do something with a project, you must figure out where the project locates. 
" asynctasks.vim and its backend asyncrun.vim choose a widely used method called root markers 
" to indentify the project root directory. The project root is one of the nearest parent directory containing these markers:

" If none of the parent directories contains these root markers, the directory of the current file is used as the project root.
"
" There is a corner case: if current buffer is not a normal file buffer (eg. a tool window) or is an unnamed new buffer, 
" vim's current working directory (which :pwd returns) will be used as the project root.
"
" Once we got the project location, the macro $(VIM_ROOT), or its alias <root>, can be used to represent the project root:
"
" What if your current project is not in any git/subversion repository ? How to find out where is my project root ? 
" The solution is very simple, just put an empty .root file in your project root, it has been defined in g:asyncrun_rootmarks before.
