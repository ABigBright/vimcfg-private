" You can also prevent certain keys from being remapped by setting the g:yankstack_yank_keys to the keys of your choosing. 
" For example, if you only want Yankstack to remap y and d:
let g:yankstack_yank_keys = []

" Also, if you want to load yankstack without the default key mappings, just let g:yankstack_map_keys = 0 in your .vimrc file.
let g:yankstack_map_keys = 0
